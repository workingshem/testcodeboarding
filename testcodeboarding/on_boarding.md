## Details

The `testcodeboarding` project is structured around a clear separation of concerns, with an `Application Entry Point` module (`app.py`) responsible for initiating the application's execution. This entry point orchestrates calls to the `Core Arithmetic Operations` module (`func.py`), which encapsulates the fundamental business logic for performing arithmetic calculations. The `main` function within `app.py` serves as the primary control flow mechanism, invoking arithmetic functions like `add` and `mul` from `func.py` to perform its tasks. This design promotes modularity and maintainability, allowing for independent development and testing of core functionalities. The data flow is straightforward: the `Application Entry Point` calls functions within `Core Arithmetic Operations`, which then return results back to the entry point for further processing or display.

### Application Entry Point
The primary orchestrator of the CLI tool, responsible for initiating the application and directing control flow.
