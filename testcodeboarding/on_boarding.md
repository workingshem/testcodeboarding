## Details

The application follows a clear service-oriented architecture, centered around a CLI Handler that serves as the primary interface for user interaction. This handler orchestrates calls to the User Service for managing user-related operations, such as creation and retrieval, and the Order & Calculation Core for handling order processing and financial calculations. Both services rely on the Data Models component, which defines the core data structures (User, Order) ensuring consistent data representation across the application. This design promotes modularity, allowing for independent development and maintenance of each component while maintaining clear interaction pathways for data flow and functional execution.

### CLI Handler
The application's primary entry point, responsible for parsing command-line arguments, dispatching commands, and orchestrating the overall application flow based on user input.
