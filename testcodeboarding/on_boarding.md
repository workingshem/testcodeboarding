## Details

The `testcodeboarding` project is structured around a central `Application Entry Point` responsible for initiating and coordinating the application's flow. This entry point, defined in `app.py`, interacts directly with the `Core Functionality - Arithmetic Operations` component, which encapsulates fundamental arithmetic logic in `func.py`. The `Application Entry Point` leverages the arithmetic operations provided by `Core Functionality` to perform calculations, demonstrating a clear separation of concerns where the main application logic orchestrates calls to a dedicated set of functional utilities. This architecture facilitates maintainability and modularity, allowing for independent development and testing of core functionalities.

### Application Entry Point
Serves as the primary entry point and orchestrator for the application, defining the high-level sequence of actions.
